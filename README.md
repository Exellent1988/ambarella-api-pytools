Python scripts to talk to action cameras using the Ambarella WiFi API

Python scripts examples to interact with the Ambarella WiFi API, tested on
the SJCAM SJ8 Pro action camera with firmware 1.3.2. Core functions
are contained into the **ambarella_api.py** module, which provides
low-level and mid-level functions to send and receive messages to
the action camera. Messages are in JSON format.

Connect your host (e.g. your PC or a mobile device) to the WiFi
access point offered by the camera; default ESSID is something
like **SJ8PRO_XXXXXX_2.4G** and default password is **12345678**.

The IP address of the camera is **192.168.42.1** and API socket is
listening on port **7878/TCP**.

Beware that the protocol is asyncronous and you can get messages
generated by touchscreen operations, beside the ones generated
by API interaction.
